This is an implementation of a HashMap in C. Why would you create this you may ask? I'm bored in hotel quarantine in Japan and have literally nothing better to do (except study for my exams... oops!

How do we do [hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function)?

Hash functions should be:
- Uniform
- Efficient
- Universal
- Utilise input of any length

Our specific requirements:
- Return an `unsigned char`
